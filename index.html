			<h1>Hello I am David</h1>

			<h2>Football</h2>
			<p>
			I love Manchester City.
			</p>
			<p>
			I have alwyas loved football, as I played it since I was a little boy. When I was 13 years old, I travelled to England to visit family. They support Manchester City and took me to a match. From that day on, I have loved Manchester City, and will for the rest of my life.

			<h2>Basketball</h2>
			<p>
			I love the New York Knicks.
			</p>
			<p>
			Being from New York, I either will like the Knicks or Nets as my basketball team. The Knicks are one of the most famous teams in the enitre league, having a rich history of winning. Over the last 20-30 years the Knicks organization has been a big mess and being a fan has not been fun. I am a loyal supporter though and will cheer my team on through the good and bad times.

		<div class="card-white">
			<h2>American Football</h2>
			<p>
			I love the New York Jets.
			</p>
			<p>
			The New York Jets have been my favorite American football team since I was a little boy. There are pictures of me wearing jets jerseys when I was 3 years old with my dad. My dad grew up a Jets fan and is keeping the tradition going by passing it on to me. Like the Knicks, the Jets have had a very bad last 20-30 years but I will always have hope that one day the Jets will be good once again.
